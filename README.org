* NAME

  =calconv= - A simple calculator for size of neural networks.

* DESCRIPTION

  =calconv= calculates output size of single or multiple convolution layers.
  While =torchsummary= gets information about size of each layer by passing a random tensor through the network
  and thus need to actually allocate memory, =calconv= only uses parameters of convolution layers and works even under very limited resources.

  =calconv= is still the best choice on multiple GPUs
  when you have to deal with very high resolution (VHR) imagery like satellite imagery.
